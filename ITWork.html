							<h2> Ideal Job </h2>
							<p>Matthew Howatson</p>
							<p>I found the job of IT Support Engineer. I fundamentally love using computers, testing things out, installing new software and reinstalling operating systems, so I feel I can put this job into "my ideal job" category. These interests are good foundations of the other attributes that are required in the job.</p>
							<p>I could do this on a day to day basis</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Review, deploy and test new hardware and devices for end users
								</li>
								<li>Do daily backups</li>
								<li>Customer service and support</li>
								<li>Monitor and troubleshoot network performance</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The skills and experience needed for this job are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Proved experience as an ICT Support Engineer of Desktop Support Engineer</li>
								<li>Well versed in ITIL</li>
								<li>Ability to perform Level 1 and Level 2 service requests</li>
								<li>Service Now ticketing system</li>
								<li>General desktop, hardware and device management support</li>
								<li>Windows O/S, Windows Server 2003 - 2016, Microsoft Office</li>
								<li>Experience with MDM - Citrix XenMobile, HP Storage and backup, Tape Drive support (HP Data Protector), Veeam, VMware, vSphere, Symantec Enterprise Vault, General VOiP support (Mitel and/or Polycom)</li>
								<li>The skills that I currently have for this position are good knowledge of Operating Systems and software applications (but probably not specific applications), excellent interpersonal skills and good written and verbal communication skills.</li>
								<li>To gain the skills for this position, my plan is to obtain my Bachelor of Information Technology degree from RMIT and to get a relevant internship to get direct hands on experience as a Desktop Support Engineer or Support Technician. Both of these will increase my knowledge of operating systems, software applications and remote connection systems. Additionally, I will gain experience in solving complex hardware and software issues. In the next three years I will have significantly increase my skills and knowledge in these areas. I feel that as I continue my studies and become more knowledgeable in the different areas of Information Technology, my ideas of an ideal job may change dramatically.</li>
